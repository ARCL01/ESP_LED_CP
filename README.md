# ESP_LED_CP - Experimental ðŸ”¨

This branch is **experimental**, bugs are likely to occur.
The program may not function as intended.
Features added to this branch will always be listed in the description of the released version. Experimental releases will be only available in this branch, not in the main branch.
Every release will be tagged with one of four tags according to program functionality.

This README will be updated with a description of added functions and how to use and configure them once they are at least in a **Semi-functional** state.

### Functionality tags

  * **New-feature**
    - The basic functionality of the program remains unchanged, added features work as intended and (from my point of view) are complete.
  * **Functional**
    - The basic functionality of the program remains unchanged, added features work as intended but can be improved. 
  * **Semi-functional**
    - The basic functionality of the program is changed in a way, that the features added, can be properly tested.
  * **Non-Functional**
    - The basic functionality of the program is changed in a way, that the features added, can be properly tested.
    - Added features are not functioning as intended.

I am open to any ideas on how to improve this program.

Thank you, for taking the time to read this.
